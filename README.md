# sums666
This program searches a wordlist for words who's character's decimal ascii values sum to 666 and saves them to a file.<br /><br />
I have included a word list `words.txt` and the file `sums666.txt` which lists the words in `words.txt` who's characters decimal ascii values sum to 666.<br /><br />
The sum excludes the null character (`\0`) and the newline character (`\n`).<br />
